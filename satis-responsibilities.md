# Responsibilities with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Infrastructure Service
{: #satis-responsibilities}

Learn about the management responsibilities and terms and conditions that you have when you use {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Infrastructure Service. For a high-level view of the service types in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and the breakdown of responsibilities between you as the customer and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} for each type, see [Shared responsibilities for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities).
{: shortdesc}

Review the following sections for the specific responsibilities for you and for {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} when you use {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Infrastructure Service. For the overall terms of use, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terms and Notices](/docs/overview/terms-of-use?topic=overview-terms). For your responsibilities for other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that you use with {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}, refer to the documentation of those services, such as [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} responsibilities](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-responsibilities_iks). For example, while IBM is responsible for deploying a fully managed, highly available dedicated master, you are responsible for updating worker nodes.

These responsibilities differ from the [general {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} responsibilities](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities) because {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} Infrastructure Service is a managed infrastructure offering.
{: note}
